## Synopsis

This is a small python script (APIs included) that **warps** a source image onto a position in the  destination image. 


## Motivation

This project was motivated by the need to understand the mathematics behind projective geometry and how it can be used in a real world application. Such systems are used to project flags onto lanes of the athletes during the olympics. 

## Installation

Just include the module warp.py in your module and you can start using it right away. 

## Dependencies

The module warp.py just depends on Numpy and matplotlib libraries.  

## Example

Look at the included script test_warp.py in order to understand how to use the warp module. An example output is shown below.
